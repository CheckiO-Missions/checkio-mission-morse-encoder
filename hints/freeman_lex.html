            Catch an idea üí°! In solution I want to show you, you should move over the string and take equivalent character combination from the MORSE dictionary for each character. Then join all these combinations together and return it.

            Since all letter in MORSE are lowercase, you should make your
        text lowercase as well. Do it with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_lower.asp">lower()</a> string method:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "Hello"
print(text.lower())
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>"hello"</pre>
        </div>
    </div>

        This step is clear, but I stuck with the next and need a hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Then you should create <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">generator expression</a> to perform an operation with each character in modified text: 
        </p>        
        <pre class="brush: python">
(... for c in text.lower())
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok, but I don't understand what operation should it be.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Since MORSE is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp">dictionary</a>, use its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_access.asp">get()</a> method with two parameters. The first is "c" from generator expression, because you want to receive value (combination of characters) for "c" key. The second parameter (default value in case of key absence in dictionary) use whitespace. Its a tricky moment I explain you next step.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())
        </pre>

        <p>
            Generator expression is an Iterable and usually serves as a parameter for some function. MORSE keys and values are strings, so you need no additional transformation. You may use string method <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_join.asp">join()</a> to merge all characters into one string.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
separator.join(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())
        </pre>
    </div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        How should I get needed space between words and characters in final
        string?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You need to have 3 whitespace between words and 1 whitespace between characters in a word. So use 1 whitespace (" ") as separator, it gives you one whitespace between all characters. And here is the trick I promised you. In original text the word separator is 1 whitespace. Since there are no such key in MORSE, it takes default value - 1 whitespace instead. In your final string you use 1 whitespace as separator between all characters. So 1 whitespace separator + 1 whitespace as "character" + again 1 whitespace separator gives you desirable 3 white spaces as a separator between words in final string! 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
" ".join(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())

        That is cool! But how the final solution should looks like?

            Actually, that almost all. You just need to add function definition:
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def morse_encoder(text: str) -> str:

    return ' '.join(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())
        </pre>

        <p>
            The hints solution is brilliant, but you can make it even more compact, using lambda expression.
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
morse_encoder = lambda text: ' '.join(MORSE.get(c, ' ')
                                      for c in text.lower())        
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            If your previously add whitespace key-value pair into MORSE, you don't need of default whitespace value inside get(). Besides you may use map() function which implement some function to each element of Iterable
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
morse_encoder = lambda text: ' '.join(map(MORSE.get, text.lower()))    
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Bigger one with additional function, splitting the input text by words first, then taking characters from MORSE for each letter in a word, joining them in a new word with 1 whitespace separator, and finally joining all new words with 3 white spaces.
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def morse_encoder(text: str) -> str:

    def trans(word):
        
        return ' '.join(map(lambda char: MORSE[char], word))

    words = text.lower().split()
    text1 = '   '.join(map(trans, words))

    return text1    
        </pre>
