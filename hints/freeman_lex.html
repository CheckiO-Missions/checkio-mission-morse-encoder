        I have no idea how to start solving this mission.

    <div class="answer">
        In solution I want to show you, you should move over the string and take
        equivalent character combination from the MORSE dictionary for each character.
        Then join all these combinations together and return it.

    <div class="question">
        What instrument should I start from?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Since all letter in MORSE are lowercase, you should make your
        text lowercase as well. Do it with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_lower.asp">lower()</a> string method:
<br />
<br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "Hello"
text.lower()
>>> "hello"
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        This step is clear, but I stuck with the next and need a hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Then you should create <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">generator expression</a>
        to perform an operation with each character in modified text: 
<br />
<br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
(... for c in text.lower())
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok, but I don't understand what operation should it be.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Since MORSE is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp">dictionary</a>,
        use its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_access.asp">get()</a> method
        with two parameters. The first is "c" from generator expression, because
        you want to receive value (combination of characters) for "c" key. The
        second parameter (default value in case of key absence in dictionary)
        use whitespace. Its a tricky moment I explain you next step.
<br />
<br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I have generator expression, but I need string. Help to get it!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Generator expression is an Iterable and usually serves as a parameter
        for some function. MORSE keys and values are strings, so you need no
        additional transformation. You may use string method <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_join.asp">join()</a>
        to merge all characters into one string.
<br />
<br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
<i>separator</i>.join(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        How should I get needed space between words and characters in final
        string?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need to have 3 whitespace between words and 1 whitespace between
        characters in a word. So use 1 whitespace (" ") as separator, it
        gives you one whitespace between all characters. And here is the trick I
        promised you. In original text the word separator is 1 whitespace.
        Since there are no such key in MORSE, it takes default value - 1 whitespace
        instead. In your final string you use 1 whitespace as separator between
        all characters. So 1 whitespace separator + 1 whitespace as "character" +
        again 1 whitespace separator gives you desirable 3 whitespaces as a separator
        between words in final string! 
<br />
<br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
" ".join(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        What is cool! But how the final solution should looks like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Actually, that almost all. You just need to add function definition:
<br />
<br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def morse_encoder(text: str) -> str:

    return ' '.join(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())
        </pre>
        This solution is brilliant, but not the only way to solve this mission.
        There are more you be able to see after your code successfully passes
        all tests. For example:
        you can make this solution even more compact...
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
morse_encoder = lambda text: ' '.join(MORSE.get(c, ' ') for c in text.lower())
        </pre>
        (if your previously add whitespace key-value pair into MORSE, you
        are no need of default whitespace value inside get()). Besides you
        may use map() function which implement some function to each element
        of Iterable)
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
morse_encoder = lambda text: ' '.join(map(MORSE.get, text.lower()))
        </pre>
        ...or bigger with additional function, splitting the input text by words
        first, then taking characters from MORSE for each letter in a word, 
        joining them in a new word with 1 whitespace separator, and finally
        joining all new words with 3 whitespaces.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def morse_encoder(text: str) -> str:

    def trans(word):
        
        return ' '.join(map(lambda char: MORSE[char], word))

    words = text.lower().split()
    text1 = '   '.join(map(trans, words))

    return text1
        </pre>
